Job search service.

Modern job search services are often inconvenient or insufficiently functional, which complicates the process of searching for vacancies and interaction between employers and job seekers.

Goal: To develop a convenient and functional service that simplifies the job search and the process of responding to vacancies.

Functionality:

Viewing job openings and adding them to favorites.
Responding to job openings by sending an email to the employer on Gmail containing the applicant's resume.
Search for vacancies using the built-in search engine.
Ability to register and login for registered users.

Technology stack:

Backend: C#, using SQLite for data storage (users, jobs, companies) and Redis (using docker) for selected jobs.
Frontend: Angular for user interface development.

Developed a modern job search service that allows to conveniently find vacancies, respond to them and save interesting offers. Thanks to the use of Redis, the performance of working with selected vacancies has been improved.
The service simplifies the employment process, improves interaction between job seekers and employers and can be useful both for large companies and individual users.
